# ArudinoController
A simple p5 website containing a game where the objective is to squish all the bugs by clicking on them. The player uses an Arduino Uno with a joystick and button to aim and fire at the bugs. When a bug is successfully squished, a buzzer on the Arduino board buzzes for 0.5 seconds.
